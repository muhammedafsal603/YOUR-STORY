      <p style="margin-right: 200px;">In 2008, our venture was initiated in Kuriachira, Thrissur. At first, we handled event management tasks mostly in the limited regions close to Thrissur and its surrounds. What started as a small firm has now expanded into a multi-locality event management services in Kerala. Our hard work has enabled us to step out of the neighborhoods of Thrissur to popular territories of Calicut and Cochin. Today, Your story Events is strongly represented in Thrissur, Calicut, and Kochi – three most dynamic cities of Kerala.</p>
